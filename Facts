Facts:
1. After Saturn, a space-craft would have to travel 1,500,000,000 km to reach Uranus. This means the planet is almost twice the distance from the sun that Saturn is.
2. Uranus orbits the Sun on its side. Its south pole is pointed towards Earth. The angle of the tilt of the axis of Uranus is 97 degrees. This is probably due to an object the size of Earth smashing into Uranus during its formation billions of years ago.
3. If we were able to see Uranus' moons orbiting the planet, they would go over and under the planet like lights on a ferris wheel.
